            <h2>The Global Food Waste Challenge</h2>
            <p>Food waste is not just about uneaten scraps; it's a monumental challenge impacting our environment, economy, and even social equity. From farm to fork, countless resources are expended to produce food that often ends up in landfills. This wasteful cycle contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, depletes fresh water, and occupies vast amounts of land. By addressing food waste, we take a powerful step towards sustainability.</p>

            <h3>Why Does Food Waste Matter?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Decomposing food in landfills releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Wasting food also means wasting the water, energy, and land used for its production.</li>
                <li><strong>Economic Loss:</strong> Billions of dollars are lost globally due to wasted food at every stage of the supply chain, from farmers to consumers.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Depletion:</strong> Producing food requires vast amounts of water and fertile land. Wasting food exacerbates pressure on these finite resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethical Concerns:</strong> While tons of food are wasted, millions still go hungry. Reducing waste can help redistribute resources more effectively.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Your Role in the Solution!</h3>
            <p>Every individual action, no matter how small, contributes to a larger positive change. By adopting mindful habits, you can significantly reduce your household's food waste. It's easier than you think!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Smart Shopping:</strong> Plan meals, check your pantry, and stick to a list to avoid impulse buys that lead to excess.</li>
                <li><strong>Mastering Storage:</strong> Proper storage can extend the life of fruits, vegetables, and leftovers. Learn what goes where!</li>
                <li><strong>Date Decoding:</strong> Understand the difference between "best by" and "use by" dates to reduce premature disposal.</li>
                <li><strong>Creative Cooking:</strong> Transform forgotten ingredients into delicious new meals. Leftovers can be exciting!</li>
                <li><strong>Compost Power:</strong> For unavoidable scraps, composting turns waste into valuable soil, completing the natural cycle.</li>
            </ul>
